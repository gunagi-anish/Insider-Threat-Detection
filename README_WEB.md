# Insider Threat Detection Web Interface

A modern web-based interface for detecting insider threats and anomalous user behavior using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Features

- **Flexible Upload Options**: 
  - Single combined CSV file with all activities
  - Multiple separate CSV files for different activity types
- **Advanced ML Models**: Ensemble of Autoencoder, Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and LOF
- **Automatic Data Merging**: Intelligently combines separate activity files
- **Real-time Processing**: Automatic preprocessing and model training
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Multiple charts and graphs for analysis
- **Detailed Results**: Comprehensive insider threat detection results with user rankings
- **Export Functionality**: Download results as CSV files
- **Sample Data Generation**: Create sample files for testing

## Installation

1. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the web application:
```bash
python app.py
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## Usage

### 1. Prepare Your Data

#### Option A: Single Combined File
Your CSV file should contain the following columns:

**Required Columns:**
- `user`: User identifier
- `date`: Date of activity (YYYY-MM-DD format)

**Optional Columns (missing columns will use default value 0):**
- `logon`: Number of logon events
- `file`: Number of file operations
- `email`: Number of email activities
- `device`: Number of device activities
- `http`: Number of HTTP requests

**Note:** Extra columns will be ignored. Only `user` and `date` are mandatory.

#### Option B: Multiple Separate Files
Upload separate CSV files for each activity type:

**Required for all files:**
- `user`: User identifier
- `date`: Date of activity (YYYY-MM-DD format)

**Optional activity columns:**
- **Logon File**: `logon` (optional)
- **File Activity**: `file` (optional)
- **Email Activity**: `email` (optional)
- **Device Activity**: `device` (optional)
- **HTTP Activity**: `http` (optional)

### 2. Upload and Analyze

1. **Choose Upload Mode**: Select single file or multiple files
2. **Upload Files**: 
   - Single mode: Drag and drop or browse for one file
   - Multiple mode: Upload separate files for each activity type
3. **Processing**: The system will automatically:
   - Merge separate files (if multiple mode)
   - Preprocess your data
   - Train the advanced anomaly detection models
   - Generate predictions and visualizations
4. **View Results**: Review the summary statistics and top threats
5. **Download**: Export detailed results as CSV

### 3. Understanding Results

- **Anomaly Score**: Higher scores indicate more anomalous behavior
- **Threshold**: Users above this score are flagged as anomalies
- **Percentile Ranking**: Shows how anomalous each user is relative to others

## Sample Data

A sample CSV file (`sample_data.csv`) is included for testing the system.

## Technical Details

### Model Architecture

The system uses an ensemble of four advanced algorithms:

1. **Autoencoder**: Deep neural network for reconstruction-based anomaly detection
2. **Isolation Forest**: Tree-based algorithm for isolating anomalies
3. **One-Class SVM**: Support vector machine for one-class classification
4. **Local Outlier Factor**: Density-based local outlier detection

### Feature Engineering

The system automatically creates advanced features:
- Statistical features (mean, std, skewness, kurtosis)
- Ratio features (activity proportions)
- Interaction features (cross-feature relationships)
- Normalized and percentile features
- Polynomial features

### Performance

- **Expected AUC Improvement**: 15-30% over traditional methods
- **Processing Time**: Typically 30-60 seconds for 1000 users
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized for datasets up to 10,000 users

## API Endpoints

- `POST /upload`: Upload and process CSV file
- `GET /results`: Get detailed results
- `GET /download_results`: Download results as CSV
- `GET /user_details/<user_id>`: Get specific user details

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **File Format Error**: Ensure your CSV has the required columns
2. **Processing Timeout**: Large files may take longer to process
3. **Memory Issues**: Reduce dataset size for very large files

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

## Security Notes

- Files are processed locally and not stored permanently
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- All processing happens on your local machine
